# ANN_manualcoding
Artificial neural networks are computing models based on human neural systems. ANN consists of nodes that are connected and form a complete-oriented graph. The graph divides into input, output, and hidden layers and computes the probability based on each connection weight. This project was manually coding an Ann model.

# Dataset and normalization
The Dataset we are training our code for is Mnist. We chose the Mnist Dataset for its simplicity. Each test data has a label so we could train the model based on the labels. We need a 10*1 vector of the encoded label for each train data.
